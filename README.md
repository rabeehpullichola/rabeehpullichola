### 💻 Key Security & Technical Projects

Here are some projects demonstrating practical application of security and engineering principles:

* **ESP8266 WiFi Deauther:** Designed and implemented a compact security tool aimed at assessing network vulnerabilities. Programmed the ESP8266 module to scan and identify active WiFi networks and simulated controlled attack scenarios using deauthentication protocols.
* **Secured IoMT Wearables Design:** Investigated smart fabric applications to enhance IoMT device security for my Master's dissertation at Northumbria University.
* **Network Vulnerability Assessment:** Analysed network traffic using **Wireshark** and performed port scanning with **Nmap**, resulting in the documentation of **20+ security risks** and the implementation of recommended mitigation strategies.

### 💡 Recent Professional Development

* **Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Program (Forage):** Completed a job simulation focused on serving as an analyst on the Security Awareness Team. Identified and reported security threats (e.g., phishing) and implemented training courses based on business needs.
* **Datacom Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage):** Investigated a cyberattack, produced a comprehensive report outlining findings, and conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for a client.
