### 💻 Key Security & Technical Projects

Here are some projects demonstrating practical application of security and engineering principles:

* **ESP8266 WiFi Deauther:** Designed and implemented a compact security tool aimed at assessing network vulnerabilities. [cite_start]Programmed the ESP8266 module to scan and identify active WiFi networks and simulated controlled attack scenarios using deauthentication protocols[cite: 53, 56].
* [cite_start]**Secured IoMT Wearables Design:** Investigated smart fabric applications to enhance IoMT device security for my Master's dissertation at Northumbria University[cite: 51, 52].
* [cite_start]**Network Vulnerability Assessment:** Analysed network traffic using **Wireshark** and performed port scanning with **Nmap**, resulting in the documentation of **20+ security risks** and the implementation of recommended mitigation strategies[cite: 58].

### 💡 Recent Professional Development

* [cite_start]**Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Program (Forage):** Completed a job simulation focused on serving as an analyst on the Security Awareness Team[cite: 61, 62]. [cite_start]Identified and reported security threats (e.g., phishing) and implemented training courses based on business needs[cite: 63, 64].
* [cite_start]**Datacom Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage):** Investigated a cyberattack, produced a comprehensive report outlining findings, and conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for a client[cite: 66, 67, 68].
